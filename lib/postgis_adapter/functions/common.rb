  # True if the given geometries represent the same geometry.

  # Returns TRUE if the given Geometries are "spatially equal".
  # Use this for a 'better' answer than '='. Note by spatially equal we
  # mean ST_Within(A,B) = true and ST_Within(B,A) = true and also mean ordering
  # of points can be different but represent the same geometry structure.
  # To verify the order of points is consistent, use ST_OrderingEquals
  # (it must be noted ST_OrderingEquals is a little more stringent than
  # simply verifying order of points are the same).

  # This function will return false if either geometry is invalid even
  # if they are binary equal.

  # Returns the minimum bounding box for the supplied geometry, as a geometry.
  # The polygon is defined by the corner points of the bounding box
  # ((MINX, MINY), (MINX, MAXY), (MAXX, MAXY), (MAXX, MINY), (MINX, MINY)).
  # PostGIS will add a ZMIN/ZMAX coordinate as well/
  #
  # Degenerate cases (vertical lines, points) will return a geometry of
  # lower dimension than POLYGON, ie. POINT or LINESTRING.
  #
  # In PostGIS, the bounding box of a geometry is represented internally using
  # float4s instead of float8s that are used to store geometries. The bounding
  # box coordinates are floored, guarenteeing that the geometry is contained
  # entirely within its bounds. This has the advantage that a geometry's
  # bounding box is half the size as the minimum bounding rectangle,
  # which means significantly faster indexes and general performance.
  # But it also means that the bounding box is NOT the same as the minimum
  # bounding rectangle that bounds the geome.

  # Computes the geometric center of a geometry, or equivalently,

  # line segment. For [MULTI]POLYGONs, "weight" is thought in terms of area.
  # If an empty geometry is supplied, an empty GEOMETRYCOLLECTION is returned.
  # If NULL is supplied, NULL is returned.
  #
  # The centroid is equal to the centroid of the set of component Geometries of
  # highest dimension (since the lower-dimension geometries contribute zero
  # "weight" to the centroid).
